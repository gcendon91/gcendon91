# Hello there

<p>Hi, I’m Gonzalo Cendón from Argentina</p>
<p>Here you will find my practice projects for learning purposes and also how I try out new tools that I learn along the way.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and at <a href="https://www.istea.edu.ar/">ISTEA</a></p>
